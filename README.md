# StenoPass
Steno pass is basesed on a project here https://github.com/syvaidya/openstego
Steno pass is a sort of password manager which uses the open stego library and some batch files to store a password cheat sheet file in a stenographed image. 
the "software" if you could call it that, when run prompts your for your passowrd and then unpacks and unencrypts your "proteected file"
after you close and hopefull save your file, it automaticlly re-encrypts/hides the data. 
If you want to use this, go ahaead, but I take no responsibiblty if you lose data.  Back up your files before using until you are confident that you won't lose anything. 
to install and use it, download the zip file, extract it, and follow the instructions provided. 

I have this: https://en.softonic.com/download/bat-to-exe-converter-x64/windows/post-download app packaged in the .zip because it is nessasary to set 
up StenoPass.

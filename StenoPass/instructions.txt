1. run installer exe and carefully follow the directions.  that should be all you need to do. 
2. in order to run the installer, double click installer.bat. 

Further note: if you have antivirus, it will likly be a problem. 
You will have to make an exemtion for the exe file once its created.  
With bitdefender the way you do that is by going into protection>settings>manage exceptions
Then you click add and exception and follow the prompts.
